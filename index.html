            <h2>The Twins & The Sword Of Zandor </h2>
            <p></p>
        </div>
        <div class="page">
            <h1>Page 2</h1>
            <p>Once upon a time, in the beautiful African kingdom of Zandor, two sweethearts, King Kofi, and Queen Adwoa met when they
            were young, fell in love, and eventually got married.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page">
            <h1>Page 3</h1>
            <p>The couple planned on having one strong son to someday rule the kingdom. However, on the day of birth, twin boys were
            born, Olu and Uba. The citizens of Zandor adored the brothers and even described the two as inseparable, always playing
            and exploring the kingdom together.
</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page">
        <h1>Page 4</h1>
        <p>One day, King Kofi woke up with a bad sickness, and it was declared that the king only had a few days left to live. A
        big problem was presented to the kingdom, as the ruling was in jeopardy. With the king near death, he decided that his
        two sons would fight for the right to rule the kingdom, for only one could be king.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="page">
        <h1>Page 5</h1>
        <p>The people of Zandor were shocked as there were many other solutions for finding a king that didn’t entail violence.
        Despite objections, the king's ruling was final. He felt that this was the only way to determine who was truly worthy of
        leading Zandor, by showing their perseverance to the test. The two twins would fight in the kingdom's courtyard the next
        day at noon.
</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
        <h1>Page 6</h1>
        <p>When noon came, the people of Zandor assembled at the Kingdom Courtyard, from children to the elderly. Speculation about
        the future victorious brother rose, and the people were even placing bets. The fight began as they both bowed to each other and the official yelled, "3-2-1 fight".
</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
        <h1>Page 7</h1>
        <p>The battle began as the twin princes cautiously circled each other, hesitant to make the first move. Olu threw the first
        punch, striking Uba in his cheek, motivating Uba to not hold back. According to legend, the battle went on for two
        grueling hours, consisting of many punches and kicks. But finally, after many hours and much blood loss, Uba was looking
        like the future winner. However, it was until then, a tired Uba made a misstep and stumbled on a rock while trying to
        kick, dropping to the floor head first. Olu got on top of Uba and wrapped his arm around Uba's neck, choking Uba with
        every muscle in his bicep. Leaving Uba no choice but to tap out into submission to avoid being choked out.
</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
        <h1>Page 8</h1>
        <p>Olu was victorious, causing the audience to erupt in cheer and applause while some child fans of Uba even wept. Both
        brothers stood up, gave their finishing bow to each other, and Uba congratulated Olu, blood dripping from the head of a
        furious Uba. A few days later, King Kofi died, and Uba didn’t attend his funeral due to the devastation on his mind. He
        stayed inside his room for weeks, thinking to himself had he not tripped, he would’ve won. He knew this loss would
        affect the rest of his life; he would never become king.
</p>
        </div>
<div class="page">
        <h1>Page 9</h1>
        <p>Uba eventually changed and he began to develop a strong resentment towards Olu. He became so jealous of Olu that Uba,
        consumed by his own desire for power, began learning dark magic to become more powerful, and he began to torment people,
        putting spells on them. After Olu heard about Uba’s wrongdoings, he had a talk with Uba.
</p>
        </div>
<div class="page">
        <h1>Page 10</h1>
        <p>Brother, what the hell are you doing? Is what I've been hearing true?” Olu said.
        Uba laughed. "Yes, and I intend to secure the throne of Zandor for its rightful ruler, me."Olu was so disappointed, and as king, he had no choice but to banish his own brother from the kingdom of Zandor. Uba
        told his brother, “I’ll be back.”
</p>
    </div>
<div class="page">
       <h1>Page 11</h1>
        <p>A few years go on in peaceful Zandor when Olu decides to visit his secret museum and notices a missing artifact. “The
        kingdom is facing a new challenge,” he told himself. A mighty sword, known as the Sword of Great Zandor, had been stolen
        from Olu’s museum without being noticed. This sword was not just any ordinary sword; it was said to possess magical
        powers that could defeat any army and bring victory to its wielder. King Olu was aware of only one person who had the
        capability to enter the highly secretive museum, and that person was Prince Uba, his brother who hadn’t been seen in
        years.
</p>
        </div>
<div class="page">
        <h1>Page 12</h1>
        <p>As King Olu sat in his palace he couldn’t help but feel a sense of pressure because if he didn’t act fast enough it
        could be the end of his kingdom. While thinking of a plan a wise old wizard named Baba, entered the room. "Your Majesty,
        I may have some information that can help you with your quest," Baba said.
        Olu stood up and begged, "Baba, Anything, I need to retrieve that sword for Zandor before it's too late."
</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
        <h1>Page 13</h1>
        <p>Baba nodded. "I have looked over the ancient books, and it is said that the Sword of Great Zandor has a very special
        power. It can only be used by the true ruler of Zandor, and will only reveal itself to the one who has the purest heart
        and strongest determination."
        "How does that help me?" said Olu
        Baba grinned. "It means that the sword will lead you to where it is"
        Olu looked doubtful, but Baba continued. "You must clear your mind, concentrate on your goal, and the sword's power will
        lead you."
</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
        <h1>Page 14</h1>
        <p>Olu nodded and closed his eyes. He focused all his energy on finding the Sword of Great Zandor, and after a few seconds,
        he saw a flash in his mind of a palace, like an angel calling to him. He opened his eyes."Baba, I know where I need to
        go."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
        <h1>Page 15</h1>
        <p>Later that day an announcement was made by Olu “The Sword Of Great Zandor has gone missing and it is now in the hands of
        evil, my brother Uba has stolen it and he plans to pair the sword with dark magic, and activate the powers of the sword
        and take the throne of Zandor, but I'm not gonna let that happen. I'm going on a journey to retrieve that sword and make
        sure it is never in the hands of evil again.”</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
        <h1>Page 16</h1>
        <p>Olu got his horse and set out on the journey to recover the lost Sword Of Great Zandor. He rode through the scorching
        desert, up steep mountains, and faced many other environmental challenges along the way. He even encountered a fierce
        beast who breathed fire. Olu was met along the way by a few of Uba's minions who were trying to stop him from reaching
        his Uba but Olu was too committed and erased them all.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
        <h1>Page 17</h1>
        <p>Despite all the obstacles, Olu stayed determined, for he knew that the fate of the kingdom and its people was at stake.
        He accepted that it was his duty as king to protect his people and keep them safe.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
        <h1>Page 18</h1>
        <p>Finally, after many long days of wandering around west Africa looking for his brother, there he was, Uba standing at the
        mountaintop with minions behind him and dark clouds. He knew that he had to be careful, with the sword Uba would be a
        powerful warrior who was capable of great evil.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
        <h1>Page 19</h1>
        <p>Olu entered the castle, and he encountered Uba, who was waiting for him with the Sword of Great Zandor in his hand. The
        two brothers stood face to face, and Uba taunted Olu, telling him that he would never be able to defeat him. However, Olu was not intimidated. He raised his sword, and the two brothers engaged in a fierce battle. The fight was
        intense, with both brothers using their skills to try to gain the upper hand. But in the end, Olu struck the Sword of
        Zandor breaking the Sword into two pieces and flying out of Uba’s hand leaving Uba with no sword and Olu showing no
        mercy and emerging victorious.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
        <h1>Page 20</h1>
        <p>With Uba defeated, Olu returned to the kingdom of Zandor as a hero, and the people of Zandor rejoiced. Although Uba had
        become evil he was still Olu’s brother and Olu decided to hold a funeral service for Uba. Before putting his corpse to
        rest a procedure was performed and it was determined that Uba had suffered brain damage and there was a great chance
        that this turned Uba evil. Olu was devastated that it wasn’t even Uba’s fault, but he moved on.
</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
        <h1>Page 21</h1>
        <p>The kingdom was once again at peace, and the Sword of Great Zandor was placed in a museum, where it would remain
        forever, a reminder of the bravery and determination of King Olu to protect his people.
</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
        <h1>Page 22</h1>
        <p>From that day forward, Olu ruled Zandor with wisdom and fairness, and he was remembered as one of the greatest kings in
        the kingdom's history. And Uba’s legacy is forever tarnished by his greed and desire for power.
