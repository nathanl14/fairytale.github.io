			<p>Once upon a time, in the African kingdom of Zandor, two sweethearts King Kofi and Queen Adwoa got married and planned on
			having one son, someday ruling the kingdom but on the day of birth, twin boys named Olu and Uba were born. The two
			brothers were best friends and inseparable until one day the kingdom's ruling was in jeopardy and their father, king
			Kofi, was near death. It was then that he declared that the twin princes fight for the right to rule the kingdom, for
			only one of them could be king.</p>

			<h1>Page 2</h1>
			<p>The people were shocked but they did not complain, as long as long as the got a new king. At noon everyone gathered in
			the Kingdom Courtyard and there was lots of speculation about who would win this battle for the throne since they were
			twin brothers. The fight began as they both bowed to each other and the umpire yells "fight".</p>

			<p>They both fought with everything they had, as they threw punches and kicks. But finally after
			many hours and much blood loss, the umpire announced that Olu was the winner and he would be become the new king over his brother, Uba.</p>

			<p>Uba became jealous and this feeling of jealousy turned into resentment and eventually, Olu became so consumed by his own
			desire for power he began using dark magic to torment people and become more powerful. King Kofi eventually died and Olu succeded his father. After Olu heard about Uba wrongdoings,
			 as king he had no choice but to banish his own brother from the kingdom of Zandor.</p>
